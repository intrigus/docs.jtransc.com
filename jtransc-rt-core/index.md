`jtransc-rt-core` is a library containing some meaningful JTransc annotations, and classes that work for JVM but that are optimized when converted to other targets in JTransc. Since its classes work on plain JVM, you can include it even if you are not using JTransc at all.

You can find [available annotations here](/jtransc-rt-core/annotations) and [optimized classes here](/jtransc-rt-core/optimized-api).
